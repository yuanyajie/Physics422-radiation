# Electromagnetic fields of a moving point charge

In this project, we are going to use the `PyCharge` python package (<https://pycharge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>) to simulate the electromagnetic fields of moving charges. Please see the jupyter notebook `radiation.ipynb` for detailed description of the project.

## How to Run the Jupyter Notebook

### Running on your own machine

You can download the jupyter notebook to your own computer and run it. In order to run the jupyter notebook, you need to have python3 installed. Additionally, numpy, matplotlib,Jupyterlab are needed. You can install these by running the following commands in your terminal:

    pip install numpy
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install jupyterlab

We use [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to make movies. This is not a part of python and you need to install it separately.

After installing all the above dependendies, you can start jupyter lab interface from your terminal by the following command

    jupyter lab

This will open up a browser window with the jupyter lab interface.

Alternatively, you can open and run the jupyter notebook in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
